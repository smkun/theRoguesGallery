                    <p>The name <em class="highlight-text">Fenric Staghorn</em> carries weight in the northern reaches of Averlys, spoken with the reverence reserved for those who have earned their place through blood, sweat, and sacrifice. Among the <em class="highlight-text">Hornvar</em>, respect flows not from honeyed words or inherited titles, but from deeds etched deep into memory and carved into the very bones of the land. Fenric's antlers mark him as full-grown, twelve points spread wide like the branches of an ancient oak, but it is the weathering of his dark brown hide and the deep lines that crease the corners of his forest-green eyes that tell the truer story of his years.</p>

                    <p>He is a <em class="highlight-text">Warden of Renewal</em>, one of the sacred guardians charged with restoring what has been broken and driving back the creeping rot that seeks to claim all living things. It is a burden few choose willingly, and fewer still can bear for long. The calling demands everything: strength of arm, clarity of mind, and a willing heart to sacrifice for strangers who may never know your name.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The Hornvar make their homes where winter's grip never fully loosens, their villages nestled deep in ancient forests and sprawling fens, where morning fog drifts like spirits between towering black pines and the frozen ground holds the memory of countless snows. Here, beneath skies heavy with perpetual twilight, Fenric learned his earliest lessons. His mother taught him to walk silently on frozen marsh, placing each hoofstep with the care of a hunter. His father showed him how to read the secret language written in lichen on weathered stone, and how to catch the subtle shift in wind that carried the musk of predators on the prowl.</p>
                    <p>Before young Fenric could properly lift his first shield or speak his first cantrip, he was already tending the sacred healing pools that bubbled up from the heart of the <em class="highlight-text">Ashenfen</em>, natural springs warmed by deep earth magic, their waters rich with minerals that could mend bone and purge poison.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>His true path as a druid began in the <em class="highlight-text">Circle's ancient rites of Renewal</em>, where the turning seasons were revealed not as mere marks on a calendar, but as living forces to be courted with ritual, honored with sacrifice, and when the need arose, defended with blood and magic. The Circle taught that all things moved in cycles: life and death, growth and decay, hope and despair. A Warden's duty was to ensure those cycles remained in balance, to nurture what could flourish and cull what threatened to consume.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Year of Black Hooves</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Fenric's first true trial came in what the songs now call the <em class="highlight-text">Year of Black Hooves</em>, when the dreaded <em class="highlight-text">Blight Herd</em> surged forth from the Dead Tundra like a plague given form. These were no ordinary beasts; once noble elk and caribou, they had been twisted by ancient corruption into something monstrous. Their flesh hung in rotting tatters, revealing yellow bone beneath. Their eyes had clouded to the color of spoiled milk, yet they moved with terrible purpose, driven by an insatiable hunger for life itself.</p>
                    <p>The herd moved like a winter storm made manifest, their hoofbeats drumming a rhythm of death across the frozen earth. Where they passed, the very ground withered, turning black and lifeless. Trees aged decades in mere moments, their bark splitting and leaves falling like tears. The Hornvar settlements stood directly in their path. Fenric met them in the frozen shallows of <em class="highlight-text">Lake Thornwick</em>, standing knee-deep in ice-crusted water with his ironwood staff in one hand and his ancestral shield in the other. The runes carved into both blazed with green fire as he called upon the deepest magics of his training.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Loggers of Varrik's Pass</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>In the peatlands of <em class="highlight-text">Varrik's Pass</em>, he faced an enemy that was more mundane but no less destructive. A company of loggers had arrived with papers bearing the king's seal, claiming the right to strip the ancient forest bare for timber and profit. They cared nothing for the delicate ecosystem they were destroying, the centuries-old trees they felled with casual brutality, or the wildlife they drove into exile.</p>
                    <p>Fenric tried reasoning with them first, explaining the long-term consequences of their actions. When words failed, he resorted to more direct measures. Working through the night, he awakened the forest's own defenses, calling upon root and branch to reclaim what was being stolen.</p>

            <section class="character-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Current Mission</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Now Fenric walks a path that leads far from the mist-shrouded fens of his homeland, drawn by visions and omens that speak of a corruption spreading through the ancient places of power. The <em class="highlight-text">Bargothian ruins</em> call to him with voices that echo in his dreams, promising knowledge that could tip the balance between renewal and decay.</p>
                    <p>His companions are an unlikely fellowship: a construct seeking purpose, an orc bound by infernal contract, a wizard drunk on his own brilliance, and others each carrying their own burdens and ambitions. Yet in their diversity, Fenric sees the same natural balance he has spent his life protecting. Different strengths, complementary weaknesses, each playing their part in the greater cycle.</p>
                    <p>The road ahead leads to places where the old magics still flow like poison through corrupted veins, where the boundary between life and death has worn thin. It is exactly the sort of work a Warden of Renewal was trained for: to cleanse what can be saved, and to burn away what cannot be allowed to spread.</p>
