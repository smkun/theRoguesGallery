                    <p>The mountains of <em class="highlight-text">Karrash</em> are not gentle. They are carved by ice, ruled by stone, and guarded by those who will bleed before they break. Dorn Coldmire was born in the high fortress of <em class="highlight-text">Karrash-Khal</em>, a citadel where every wall is both temple and battlement. Among the <em class="highlight-text">Orderborn</em>, faith is not recited. It is forged. The hammer that shapes the steel also shapes the soul.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Karrash-Khal stands as the highest fortress in the northern peaks, where the <em class="highlight-text">Divine Wielders</em> maintain their sacred order. The fortress serves three purposes: monastery, armory, and final bastion against the darkness that seeps down from the Frozen Wastes. Here, the Orderborn learn that devotion without strength is prayer without purpose.</p>
                    <p>Dorn's father, <em class="highlight-text">Thrain Coldmire</em>, served as the fortress's Master of Arms. His mother, <em class="highlight-text">Vera Ironheart</em>, tended the sacred forges where blessed weapons were born from ordinary steel. Both died when plague-wraiths descended from the highest peaks during Dorn's tenth winter. The other Divine Wielders found him three days later, still standing guard over their bodies with his father's training hammer clutched in his small hands.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Oath of the Divine Wielders</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>From his first days as an orphaned initiate, Dorn was taught that the Divine Wielders serve as the mortal arm of the heavens. They are not preachers. They are not politicians. They are shields raised in the path of darkness and hammers brought down on the heads of the faithless. His mornings began with drills in the frost-bitten courtyard, his afternoons at the forge shaping weapons for those who would wield them, and his nights in the echoing halls of the Chapel of Blades, memorizing the tenets of the Oath.</p>
                    <p>The Order follows <em class="highlight-text">Solanar, the Shining Sentinel</em>, whose light burns away corruption and whose justice strikes without mercy. But in the high mountains, they also honor <em class="highlight-text">Thaldir, the Arbiter</em>, who weighs the scales of righteous action. These twin aspects shape every Divine Wielder's training. Strength guided by wisdom. Fury tempered by justice.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Trial of the Anvil and the Flame</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>At sixteen, Dorn faced the <em class="highlight-text">Trial of the Anvil and the Flame</em>, a rite that tested both craft and conviction. Locked in the forge for three days with only ore, coal, and holy oil, he was tasked with creating a weapon worthy of a Seraph's blessing. The trial tests more than skill. It measures faith under pressure, determination when isolated, and the ability to create beauty from raw materials.</p>
                    <p>Many initiates forge swords or axes. Dorn chose to create a warhammer, following his father's path. When the doors opened, he emerged carrying a weapon of silver-steel, its head engraved with the words <em class="highlight-text">"Justice Never Falters"</em>. The hammer's handle bore his parents' names etched in mountain runes. That night, under the gaze of the fortress's great stained-glass angel, the weapon was consecrated, and Dorn was marked as a full Divine Wielder.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Dorn's early service coincided with the <em class="highlight-text">Heretic Wars</em>, a series of conflicts against cults that had taken root in isolated mountain communities. These groups worshipped entities from beyond the northern wastes, promising power in exchange for unspeakable acts. The Divine Wielders responded with systematic campaigns to root out corruption before it could spread.</p>
                    <p>His first blood was spilled in the village of <em class="highlight-text">Greystone Pass</em>, where cultists had murdered the local priest and turned the temple into a shrine to their dark patrons. Dorn's squad arrived to find children's bones arranged in ritual patterns. The sight hardened something inside him. From that day forward, he showed no mercy to those who preyed on the innocent.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Siege of Black Hollow</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>His first command came during the <em class="highlight-text">Siege of Black Hollow</em>, a mining town overrun by heretics who had turned from the mountain gods to darker pacts. The cult had captured the settlement's silver mines and was using enslaved workers to extract materials for profane rituals. Local militia attempts to retake the town had failed. The situation required Divine Wielder intervention.</p>
                    <p>Dorn led the relief force through three days of narrow tunnel fighting, where every swing of his hammer was met by claws, curses, and steel. The cultists had twisted the mine shafts into defensive positions, using slave workers as human shields. Dorn's squad had to advance carefully, room by room, tunnel by tunnel. When the town's temple was found desecrated, covered in blood-runes and filled with tortured prisoners, he stood in its doorway and swore before the shattered altar that no blasphemer would leave alive.</p>
                    <p>The final assault required Dorn to lead a charge through the main mine shaft while cultist sorcerers hurled dark magic and summoned shadow-creatures. His hammer shattered enchanted barriers and crushed the skull of the cult's high priest. By the siege's end, his armor was a patchwork of dents and holy symbols, his voice hoarse from both battle cries and prayers. The freed slaves carved his name into the restored temple's foundation stone.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Long Vigil</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>In the years that followed, Dorn became known as the <em class="highlight-text">Stone Sentinel of Karrash-Khal</em>. He guarded the <em class="highlight-text">Pilgrim's Causeway</em> in blizzard and sun, driving off bandits and beasts that would prey on the faithful. The Causeway connects the lowland temples to the mountain fortress, carrying thousands of pilgrims each year who seek blessing or guidance from the Divine Wielders.</p>
                    <p>His most famous stand occurred during the <em class="highlight-text">Night of Frozen Gates</em>. A sudden blizzard struck while a large pilgrimage was passing through the high passes. The storm brought ice-wolves and worse things from the Frozen Wastes. When the fortress gates froze shut, trapping the pilgrims outside, Dorn and a handful of brethren stood guard for six days, holding the mountain pass against repeated attacks. They fought without rest, sharing rations with pilgrims and using their own body heat to keep children warm.</p>
                    <p>When the thaw finally came, seventeen Divine Wielders had given their lives. Dorn was the last standing, his hammer cracked from overuse, his armor frozen to his body. The pilgrims still speak of the dwarf with the frost-crusted beard whose hammer rang like a church bell each time it struck. They say the sound guided lost travelers through the storm.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Corruption of Thornspire</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Dorn's reputation grew after he single-handedly cleansed the corruption at <em class="highlight-text">Thornspire Monastery</em>. The remote outpost had gone silent during winter. When spring scouts investigated, they found the monks transformed into undead horrors. Something had entered through the monastery's ancient crypts, turning the sacred ground into a nest of evil.</p>
                    <p>The High Preceptor sent Dorn alone to investigate. He spent two weeks in the corrupted monastery, fighting through undead monks and cleansing each room with blessed oil and hammer strikes. In the deepest crypt, he discovered a cult of <em class="highlight-text">Nekrulon</em> had breached the monastery's wards and poisoned the communion wine with necromantic essence.</p>
                    <p>Dorn sealed the breach, burned the tainted wine stores, and re-consecrated the monastery's altar using his own blood mixed with holy oil. The ritual cost him dearly. Gray streaks appeared in his beard, and his left hand developed a permanent tremor. But Thornspire was cleansed, and the monastery now serves as a shrine to his sacrifice.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>When word reached Karrash-Khal of ancient ruins being unearthed far to the south, sites where the old oaths had been broken and divine wards shattered, the High Preceptor summoned Dorn to his private chambers. The meeting lasted three hours. Intelligence reports spoke of <em class="highlight-text">Bargothian</em> ruins containing artifacts that predated the current pantheon. Worse, organizations were competing to claim these relics without understanding their true nature.</p>
                    <p>His orders were clear: join the fellowship already bound for those lands, restore what has been defiled, and ensure that ancient powers serve righteousness rather than corruption. The High Preceptor gave him a special blessing, marking his forehead with oil consecrated at the Shining Sentinel's own altar. The mark would identify him to other faithful and provide protection against certain forms of dark magic.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Now he walks among strangers whose methods and motives differ vastly from his own. A construct born of gnomecraft seeks purpose beyond its creators' intentions. A druid of the northern fens follows the ancient ways of renewal and balance. A lion-blood duelist hunts glory and gold in equal measure. A whispering elf-poet serves multiple masters while hiding his true loyalties. A phantom of the marshes moves through shadows seeking redemption for past sins.</p>
                    <p>Yet Dorn finds common ground in their shared purpose. Each member of this fellowship faces corruption that threatens innocent lives. Each possesses skills needed to confront the powers stirring in those ancient ruins. His hammer may solve problems differently than their approaches, but the goal remains the same: preventing ancient evil from poisoning the world.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Dorn carries more than his consecrated hammer. His shield bears the mountain runes of protection, blessed by three generations of Divine Wielders. His armor displays the scars of every major battle he has survived, each dent a reminder of evil defeated. Around his neck hangs his parents' wedding rings, reforged into a holy symbol that glows faintly when undead draw near.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, he carries the weight of his oath. The Divine Wielders swear to protect the innocent, destroy corruption, and uphold justice regardless of personal cost. This oath binds him more surely than any chain. It guides every decision, shapes every action, and provides strength when his body fails.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The road ahead leads to places where divine light has not shone for centuries. Ancient Bargothia fell because its people grew proud, believing they could master powers beyond mortal understanding. The same hubris threatens to repeat itself as organizations scramble to claim artifacts they do not comprehend.</p>
                    <p>Dorn Coldmire walks this path with hammer in hand and oath in heart. He has faced heretics in mountain passes and undead in sacred crypts. He has stood against darkness when others fled and held the line when hope seemed lost. The challenges ahead may test him in new ways, but his purpose remains unchanged.</p>
