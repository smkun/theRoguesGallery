                    <p>At eighteen, Charnak faced the Rite of First Blood. Seven young orcs ventured into the Screaming Stones territory. They met the Split Stone Clan in ambush.</p>
                    <p>The battle was brief. Brutal.</p>
                    <p><em class="highlight-text">Thokk the Brutal</em> fell fighting three enemies. <em class="highlight-text">Urgan Skullsplitter</em> tried to rally survivors but was overwhelmed. One by one, Charnak watched his companions die.</p>

                    <p>Charnak found a cracked bone bar in their cage. He worked it loose while his companions slept. The gap was too small for Grak and Morg.</p>
                    <p>He could save them all and die. Or save himself and perhaps find rescue later.</p>
                    <p>His legs moved without command. Behind him, Grak whispered:</p>

                    <p>Something answered.</p>
                    <p>The voice was a chorus of war-drums and marching boots. It spoke of absolute order. Strength through discipline. Victory through unwavering resolve.</p>

                    <p>A year later, Charnak encountered <em class="highlight-text">Lorenthil Swiftblade</em>, an elven ranger hunting corrupted dire wolves with his black panther companion <em class="highlight-text">MoJo</em>. The pack had overwhelmed an elven patrol near the Great Woods border. Charnak intervened with tactical precision.</p>
                    <p>The surviving elves were suspicious but grateful. Charnak's orcish appearance marked him as potential enemy. His supernatural discipline suggested dark military training. But he had fought with them in formation.</p>
                    <p><em class="highlight-text">MoJo</em> studied Charnak with intelligent golden eyes. The panther's acceptance came first. Animals sensed truth beneath surface appearances.</p>
                    <p>Weeks of travel followed. Lorenthil taught Charnak Elvish and refined Common. Charnak shared Badlands tactics and formation fighting. Trust grew through shared military understanding.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>For months, Charnak and Lorenthil worked together across the borderlands between the Great Woods and the Badlands. They mediated tribal disputes through strength. Established trade routes with protective escorts. Eliminated corruption-spawned monsters using coordinated tactics.</p>
                    <p>MoJo proved invaluable for scouting and silent takedowns. The panther moved like liquid shadow while Charnak provided direct assault capability. Lorenthil coordinated their efforts with ranger precision.</p>
                    <p>Each success reinforced Charnak's understanding of Malvarion's teachings. Order brought peace. Discipline enabled protection. Structure served justice.</p>
                    <p>Lorenthil kept detailed journals of their missions. His entries documented Charnak's evolution from failed warrior to tactical leader.</p>

                    <p>Their partnership faced its greatest test when a corrupted wyvern attacked near an elven outpost. The beast was massive, its hide bearing demonic influence. Obsidian scales. Eyes burning with chaos. Claws spreading disorder.</p>
                    <p>They fought with perfect coordination. Charnak's hellforged scepter shattered enhanced hide. Lorenthil's arrows found weak points while MoJo flanked with predatory precision. Their combined tactical discipline overwhelmed the wyvern's chaotic nature.</p>
                    <p>The victory proved their effectiveness as a unit. Charnak's military training, Lorenthil's woodland expertise, and MoJo's animal instincts created perfect battlefield synergy.</p>
                    <p>Word of their success spread through both elven and human settlements. A new kind of partnership. Order and nature working together against corruption.</p>

                    <p>Now operating as a proven tactical unit, they represent complementary capabilities. Charnak provides military discipline and supernatural enhancement. Lorenthil offers woodland expertise and ranged precision. MoJo adds stealth reconnaissance and animal instincts.</p>
                    <p>Meeting Dewito represents a mission opportunity for both. Proving joint tactical value while maintaining honor codes could establish permanent positions. More importantly, it provides resources for their shared objectives.</p>

                    <p>MoJo has become Charnak's most trusted scout. The panther recognizes the orc's commitment to protecting innocents. Their bond transcends species through shared purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Badlands expedition offers strategic opportunities for the entire team. Testing combined abilities. Challenging coordinated skills. Operating in territory requiring both woodland expertise and military precision.</p>
                    <p>Charnak carries the discipline Malvarion taught him. Lorenthil brings woodland wisdom and elven patience. MoJo provides the instincts that keep them all alive.</p>
