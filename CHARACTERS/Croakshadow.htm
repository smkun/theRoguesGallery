                    <p>The sewers beneath Henge run deeper than most citizens know. In the forgotten tunnels where arcane waste mingles with rainwater, <em class="highlight-text">Croakshadow Ribbleton</em> learned his trade. His webbed fingers trace lock mechanisms with the same precision his ancestors used to catch flies. His golden eyes pierce darkness that would blind surface dwellers.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Croakshadow hatched in the abandoned storm drains beneath the Mystic Market. His clutch-mother died during the Great Flood of 294, when the Conclave's failed weather experiment sent torrents through the underground warrens. The other tadpoles perished. Croakshadow survived by eating scraps that washed down from above.</p>
                    <p>Street orphans found him three days later. They taught him the rules of the undercity. Take what you need. Trust no one completely. Leave no trace.</p>
                    <p>His first theft was a moldy apple core. His reputation would grow from there.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Guild Years</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The <em class="highlight-text">Shadowbrook Guild</em> controls crime in Henge's lower districts. They recruited Croakshadow when he was twelve, after he stole a wizard's focus crystal from the Nexus Arcanum itself. The heist took three weeks of planning. He studied guard rotations, memorized patrol schedules, and mapped every vent shaft in the building.</p>
                    <p>The crystal was worthless. A practice focus, barely worth five copper pieces. The Guild cared about the method, not the prize.</p>
                    <p><em class="highlight-text">Guildmaster Vex Thornwick</em> became his teacher. She showed him how to pick locks with his webbed digits, how to climb walls using the natural grip pads on his fingertips, and how to move silently despite his amphibian size.</p>
                    <p>The Guild's jobs escalated over the years. Pickpocketing in the Market Square became burglary in the Upper Districts. Simple theft evolved into complex infiltrations requiring weeks of preparation.</p>
                    <p>Croakshadow specialized in magical security. Ward-locked doors. Enchanted safes. Spell-trapped containers. His natural resistance to certain magics made him valuable for jobs other thieves could not handle.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Mother's Secret</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Croakshadow's biggest score came from infiltrating <em class="highlight-text">Archmage Drakarn Spellbinder's</em> private study. The job seemed routine until he discovered correspondence mentioning his clutch-mother by name. Letters spoke of a Gray Order agent who died protecting Bargothian texts during the Great Flood.</p>
                    <p>One letter bore a seal he recognized. His mother's pendant, lost during the flood, carried the same symbol.</p>
                    <p>He copied everything instead of stealing it. The information revealed that his mother had been more than a sewer-dwelling ribbet. She was a scholar, an agent, a protector of ancient knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Gray Order scouts approached him three days later. They offered membership and answers about his heritage. In exchange, he would use his skills to recover artifacts from dangerous locations.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The <em class="highlight-text">Gray Order's</em> missions took Croakshadow beyond Henge's walls for the first time. Ancient tombs in the Whispering Woods. Forgotten vaults beneath border fortresses. Ruined temples where Bargothian priests once worshipped gods whose names were lost.</p>
                    <p>Each expedition taught him new skills. Reading ancient scripts. Identifying trap mechanisms that predated modern lock design. Recognizing the difference between valuable artifacts and clever forgeries.</p>
                    <p>His most dangerous assignment was retrieving a crystal tablet from the <em class="highlight-text">Sunken Archives</em> beneath Lake Thornwick. The underwater ruins were guarded by creatures that had been human once. Croakshadow's ability to hold his breath for extended periods saved his life when the magical lights failed.</p>
                    <p>The tablet contained star charts showing constellations that no longer existed. The Gray Order's scholars spent months deciphering its significance.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Word of Croakshadow's successes spread through the Guild's networks. Other organizations began making offers. The <em class="highlight-text">Whispering Daggers</em> wanted him to steal military secrets. The <em class="highlight-text">Crimson Coin</em> offered triple rates for banking information.</p>
                    <p>He declined them all. The Gray Order's work fascinated him in ways simple theft never had. Each artifact recovered revealed new pieces of history. Each expedition brought him closer to understanding his mother's sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>His daggers, <em class="highlight-text">Whisper</em> and <em class="highlight-text">Silence</em>, were gifts from the Order's armorer. The blades held enchantments that made them effective against both living and undead opponents. The hilts were wrapped in leather taken from his mother's journal, preserved after her death.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Croakshadow built a web of contacts throughout the Dale Lands. Fence dealers who asked no questions about ancient artifacts. Scholars who traded information for access to restricted texts. Tavern keepers who passed messages between Gray Order agents.</p>
                    <p>His reputation opened doors that gold could not. Village elders trusted him because he had helped recover their stolen relics. City officials looked the other way because he targeted threats to public safety.</p>
                    <p>The Shadowbrook Guild expelled him when they learned about his Gray Order connections. Vex Thornwick warned him that freelance work was dangerous without Guild protection. Croakshadow accepted the risk. His new calling mattered more than old loyalties.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Two weeks ago, <em class="highlight-text">Barlow Piff</em> found Croakshadow in a tavern near the Orbital Academy. The fence was nervous, which was unusual. Barlow dealt in information and favors, not anxiety.</p>
                    <div class="quote-box">
                        <p>"My cousin needs help. Special kind of help. Your kind of help."</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Barlow described a group seeking ancient ruins and lost knowledge. His cousin had joined their quest but needed someone with specific skills. Someone who understood old locks. Someone who could read Bargothian script.</p>
                    <p>The payment was generous. More importantly, the work aligned with Croakshadow's interests. Another chance to uncover secrets his mother died protecting.</p>

                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Barlow arranged an introduction at a roadside inn outside Henge. Three figures sat at a corner table when Croakshadow arrived. Each carried themselves with the confidence of seasoned professionals.</p>
                    <p>They explained their quest in broad terms. Ancient sites. Forgotten knowledge. Dangers that required diverse skills to overcome.</p>
                    <p>Croakshadow agreed to join them. His Gray Order training would prove valuable. His lock-picking abilities would open doors conventional methods could not breach.</p>
                    <p>What began as a favor to an old contact has become something more significant. The mysteries they seek connect to everything Croakshadow has learned about his heritage and the forces that threaten the world his mother died to protect.</p>
