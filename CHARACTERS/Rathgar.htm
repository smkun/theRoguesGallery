                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The name <em class="highlight-text">Rathgar Bloodfang</em> carries weight in the Badlands. It is spoken with admiration in some camps, with wariness in others. He was born under a merciless sun in the open wastes, where the careless found their skin burned raw and the wind carried the cries of unseen predators. His first lessons were not taught in halls but in the shifting camps of <em class="highlight-text">Clan Dustscar</em>, a <em class="highlight-text">Wanderborne</em> community that moved with the seasons and the hunt. In that life, there was no inheritance of safety. Survival was earned through action.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Badlands offered no shelter from hardship. Each dawn brought a new test. Rathgar learned to read the ground for signs of predators and prey before he could speak his first full sentences. By his tenth winter, he could tell by the tilt of a broken stone or the bend of a dry grass stalk which way the wind had turned. He rose before the sun and ran the perimeter of camp with the sentries, then worked alongside his kin to break down tents and load the supply wagons.</p>

            <section class="character-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Making of a Warrior</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>His path as a <em class="highlight-text">Prideclaw Duelist</em> began in the fighting circles of the southern caravan towns. The air there was thick with the scent of spice, sweat, and fear. On one sweltering night, Rathgar stepped into the ring to face <em class="highlight-text">Scar-Tongue</em>, a veteran known for breaking bones as easily as clay pots. The crowd mocked Rathgar for his youth, but when the signal was given, his feet moved like water over stone. He baited Scar-Tongue into lunging, turned the man's own weight against him, and sent him sprawling into the dust. Three exchanges later, Rathgar's blade touched the man's throat. The jeers died to silence. Whispers followed him through the streets for days afterward.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond the ring, Rathgar proved himself as a <em class="highlight-text">Giantblood Line-Breaker</em> in battles that left more than trophies behind. When a rival caravan tried to seize <em class="highlight-text">Clan Dustscar's</em> water and food, he met their shield wall in a thunderous charge. The sound of splintering wood and shouts of alarm mixed with the thud of bodies hitting the ground. He tore a gap wide enough for his kin to surge through and crush the enemy's center. By the time the rival commander realized the fight was lost, Rathgar was already standing on their banner, blood dripping from his arm and a grin splitting his face.</p>

            <section class="character-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Trail-Reader and Hunter</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>The endless trails shaped him even more than combat. As a <em class="highlight-text">Wanderborne Trail-Reader</em>, he learned the language of the land. In the <em class="highlight-text">Shatterspine Ridges</em>, he tracked a wounded ash-bear for two days through knife-edged stone and bitter wind. On the second night, under a hard moon, he spotted its pale fur ahead. The beast turned to meet him in silence. The fight was short but savage, ending with Rathgar standing over its still body, his chest heaving and his blade sunk to the hilt. He kept the pelt not for glory but as a reminder that no prey, no matter how fierce, could hide forever.</p>
                    
                    <p><em class="highlight-text">Clan Dustscar's</em> life was one of constant movement, but the call of the <em class="highlight-text">Beast Fest</em> was different. Word of it reached Rathgar in a smoky tavern, carried by a trader with a half-healed scar across his jaw. The stories promised battles against creatures that could crush wagons with a single blow or vanish into the air like smoke. They promised renown, and with it the chance to measure his scars against legends.</p>

            <section class="character-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Beast Fest</h2>
                <div class="character-text">
                    <p>Rathgar prepared for the journey with the same discipline that had carried him through every fight. He sparred daily in the camp circle, often against two or three opponents at once. He tested his blade against the armor and hides of beasts brought down by his kin, adjusting the weight and balance until it felt like an extension of his arm. At night, he walked the perimeter under the stars, whispering to himself the names of every place he had fought, every rival he had faced, and every oath he had yet to fulfill.</p>
                    
                    <p>The journey to the festival was its own proving ground. Crossing the <em class="highlight-text">Salt Wastes</em>, Rathgar fought off a pack of dune-wolves that shadowed the caravan for three nights. In the <em class="highlight-text">Ironflow Gorge</em>, he stood against a river lizard the size of a wagon, holding it at bay long enough for his people to escape the crumbling ledge. These victories were not celebrated with feasts or parades. In the way of <em class="highlight-text">Clan Dustscar</em>, they were acknowledged with a nod, a clasp of the forearm, and the unspoken promise that the debt would be repaid when the time came.</p>
                    
                    <p>The gates of the <em class="highlight-text">Beast Fest's</em> host city had once risen before him, promising challenges worthy of his scars. He fought there in battles that tested every skill he had honed since childhood. He bled in the sand, stood over beasts that had slain dozens before him, and left with honors that brought his name beyond the Badlands. For Rathgar, the festival was not the end of his wandering. It was a crucible that burned away hesitation and left only purpose.</p>

                    <p>Years have passed since those hunts. The dust of the arena no longer clings to his boots. His path now lies with an unlikely band of companions whose ambitions reach beyond the next battle. Together they follow fragments of maps and whispers of ancient stone, chasing the promise of a lost city buried under centuries of ruin and secrecy. The road ahead is long, and the dangers are not beasts alone, but hunger, treachery, and the weight of a mystery older than any of them. Rathgar walks it with the same steady resolve he carried into the <em class="highlight-text">Beast Fest</em>. The quarry is different, but the hunt is the same.</p>
